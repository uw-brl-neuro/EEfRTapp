            Successful completion of hard-task trials requires you to make {master.get_hard_press_level()} button spacebar presses, using the nondominant little finger within {master.get_hard_time_limit()} seconds, while successful completion of easy-task trials requires you to make {master.get_easy_press_level()} button spacebar presses, using the dominant index finger within {master.get_easy_time_limit()} seconds.
            
            For easy-task trials, you are eligible to win the same amount, $1.00, on each trial if you successfully completed the task. For hard-task choices, you are eligible to win higher amounts that varied per trial within a range of ${master.get_reward_lowerbound()} â€“ ${master.get_reward_upperbound()}.
            
            However, you are not guaranteed to win the reward even if you complete the task; some trials are 'win' trials, in which you received the stated reward, while others are 'no win' trials, in which you received no reward for that trial.
            
            To help you determine which trials are more likely to be win trials, you will be provided with the probability of it being a winning trial at the beginning of each trial. The level of probabilities are 88%, 50%, or 12%.
            
            At the beginning of each trial, you will have a 5-second choice period in which you are presented with information regarding the probability of winning and the reward magnitude of the hard task.
            
            You had {(master.get_maximum_time() / 60).__round__(2)} minutes to play as many trials as you could. Be careful that since hard-task trials take approximately twice as much time to complete as easy-task trials, the number of trials that the you are able to play depended in part on the choices that you made. This meant that making more hard-task trials toward the beginning of the experiment could reduce the total number of trials, which could in turn mean that you did not get a chance to play high- value, high-probability trials that might have appeared towards the end of the playing time.
